# Code of Conduct

This project follows a simple principle: be respectful, constructive, and inclusive.

- Treat all contributors and users with respect.
- Assume good intent, but give clear feedback when something is wrong.
- Avoid harassment, personal attacks, or discriminatory language.
- Focus on technical issues and project goals, not individuals.

If you encounter behavior that violates this spirit, you can:

- Open an issue in the repository (if you feel comfortable), or
- Contact the maintainers privately if a contact address is listed in the project metadata.

Maintainers may moderate issues, PRs, or discussions to keep the project welcoming and on-topic (for example by editing or hiding comments, or in extreme cases, blocking users).
